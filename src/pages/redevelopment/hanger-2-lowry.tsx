    "The transformation of the historic 1939 Hangar 2 at Lowry into a vibrant neighborhood meeting place includes restaurants, public art, small entrepreneurial office and retail suites  as well as Montessri Casa International School. The hangar interior provides climate controlled storage space for Lowryâ€™s homes and local businesses. The entire property creates a pedestrian-friendly streetscape and outdoor dining areas connecting the massive historic hangar with the surrounding community. The renovated hangar has a 105kW solar power system for the building and an energy efficient design. It also  incorporates a 400kW community solar array allowing solar panels to be purchased by Denver residents to offset their power needs.",
